    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Thoughts & Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "What are your preferred pronouns and would you like to be called by a different name than your legal name?\n",
    "- he/him\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe your engineering interests and experience\n",
    "- I'm an ECE primarily focused on firmware/embedded systems, but have also done hardware design work throughout my time on the Formula team.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would you like to get out of this course?\n",
    "- I'm partcularly interested in learning how the various types of power converters I've used in projects work under-the-hood, and while I don't necessarily see designing power converters as a big part of my future, I hope learning about them will help me make more informed decisions in my future projects and overal a more well-rounded engineer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Which aspect(s) of power electronics do you find interesting?\n",
    "- Working with EVs and in a battery context, power efficiency is always an important priority, and I'm interested to learn how various design characteristics impact conversion efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How might the field of power electronics help with environmental and social issues?\n",
    "- The application that most immediately comes to mind is the efficiency of our power grids and electrical distribution systems - by increasing energy efficiency, power electronics can save costs, reduce the amount of power lines that need to be rebuilt or repaired by maximizing their existing capacity, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from polluting energy sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Explorations\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide an example of a mixed-signal circuit\n",
    "- Something like a motor drive might be a mixed signal circuit, with analog circuitry for things like sensing, while PWM control for power and something like field oriented control would be implemented digitally\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of quantities are typically measured for the control and protection of power converters?\n",
    "- Current, Voltage, Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the \"loop\" in loop shaping?\n",
    "- The transfer function of a closed loop system\n",
    "\n",
    "How does mechanical engineering apply to the design of power converters?\n",
    "- Mechanical engineering primarily comes into play in the packaging phase, whether that's the actual assembly of the components and/or how that affects the system thermals, as well as any other requirements of the system (EMI, operating environment, space allowance, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "What purpose do inductors serve in power converters?\n",
    "- Energy storage, primarily\n",
    "\n",
    "What is currently \"all the rage\" in the field of power electronics?\n",
    "- Wide-bandgap semiconductors have created a lot of buzz due to their ability to operate in a wider temperature range and exhibit fewer switching losses than traditional semiconductors\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is James Worden?\n",
    "- James Worden is the cofounder of Solectria, who said his number one metric for assessing a power converter was efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the efficiency of a power converter matter?\n",
    "- Higher efficiency is associated with more reliable systems, reduced thermal stress, and of course fewer energy losses, which all tend to be desirable outcomes \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Which are some of the key powerstage components?\n",
    "- Components of the powerstage include power semiconductors, magnetic components, capacitors, and protective elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "List multiple ways of getting hurt or killed when working on a power converter.\n",
    "- Struck by debris from a blown component\n",
    "- Electric shock\n",
    "- Burns\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you plan on staying safe.\n",
    "- Observing recommended safety precautions when working with lab equipment, including\n",
    "    - Not touching powered hardware\n",
    "    - Wearing safety glasses and appropriate PPE\n",
    "    - Operating the hardware within recommended voltage/power ranges\n",
    "    - Operating converters with a resistive load attached to the output"
